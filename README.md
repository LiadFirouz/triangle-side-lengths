# Triangle Checker and Analyzer in Java

This repository contains two Java programs that analyze triangle side lengths. One program calculates the area and perimeter of a triangle (`Triangle1.java`), and the other checks whether three lengths can form a triangle and identifies its type (`Triangle2.java`).

## 📁 Files

- **Triangle1.java**  
  Reads three integers representing triangle side lengths, calculates the **perimeter** and **area** using Heron’s formula, and prints the results.

- **Triangle2.java**  
  Reads three integers and determines:
  - If they **can form a triangle**
  - If so, whether it is:
    - Equilateral
    - Isosceles
    - Right-angled
    - Common (no special type)
